# final code plan-final version


##### First, I need define my variables, such as bubble, fish pictures, interfaceitems(button), and positions arrays, and hitzones, some pictures(background, peach,watermelon, banana, shoes and animation pictures)and 4 soundfiles.Also the default of my picture and framerate.

##### Then, I need to preload my images, animations and music.

##### Thirdly, I create my canvas and interface buttons, and set my current background picture. Also,i add bubble, random fishes arrays and random positions of my food and set default to animations in the setup.

##### Fourthly, I add background and draw my hero fish(the eyes of my hero have mapping function) to the draw. Also, I set if statement to my hitzones to add some interesting scenarios(such as show pictures and text, play sounds and change framerate). Then I add random target fishes to the draw.
##### finallyï¼Œi write bubble ,interface and "mousepressed" functions.

# the user interaction explanation
## my project is about my hero fish, who is on his way to find food and his mate.
#### the hero fish is moving with the mouse,also the eyes of my hero have mapping movement. when you open the site, you cannot find anything, but the background music and animation start .
## There are 2 interface buttons below the background:"find your food" and "find your mate".
### find your food
#### After clicking "find your food"button, if you find food(watermelon/banana), a cheering sound plays and the bubbles move faster and animation frame becomes fast.Also, the position of these food is random.
#### if you find a non-food product that cannot be eat(shoes),a slam sound plays and the the bubble move more slowly and animation frame becomes slow.Also, the position of non-food product is random.
### find your mate
#### After clicking "find your mate"button,if you find your mate(mate is our target fish, which is random),a very brisk song will play and the environment changed. Also you will see a peachheart appearing and the animation become faster.
