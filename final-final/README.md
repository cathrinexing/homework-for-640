# final code plan-final version


##### First, I need define my variables, such as bubble, fish pictures, interfaceitems(button), and positions arrays, and hitzones, some pictures(background, peach,watermelon, banana, shoes and animation pictures)and 4 soundfiles.Also the default of my picture and framerate.

##### Then, I need to preload my images, animations and music.

##### Thirdly, I create my canvas and interface buttons, and set my current background picture. Also,i add bubble, random fishes arrays and random positions of my food in the setup.

##### Fourthly, I add background and draw my hero fish(the eyes of my hero have mapping function) to the draw. Also, I set if statements to my hitzones to add some interesting scenarios(such as showing pictures and text, playing sounds and changing framerate). Then I add random target fish to the draw,.
##### finallyï¼Œi write bubble ,interface and "mousepressed" functions.
