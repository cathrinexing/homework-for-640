# Project 4 

#### I draw a rabbit with two scenarios(forest and amusement park).I add three  hit zones at the top(carrot、broccoli、 pepper). the eyes of rabbit have mapping movement. Also,I use the mousePressed and mouseReleased to change the background color, but the background was covered by the picture. So it is invisiable.
