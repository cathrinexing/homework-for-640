# final code plan-1st version


##### First, I need define my variables, such as bubble and fish picture arrays and other pictures I need, also there are some hitzone positions and the music.

##### Then, I need to preload my images, animations and music.

##### Thirdly, I create buttons, set arrays and set default(animation and picture status) in the setup.

##### Fourthly, I add background and draw my hero fish(the eyes of my hero have mapping function) to the draw. Also, I set if statement to my hitzones to add some interesting scenarios. Then I add random target fishes to the draw. And write bubble and buttonpressed functions.

# the user interaction explanation
## my project is about my hero fish, who is on his way to find food and his mate.
#### the hero fish is moving with the mouse, when you find food, a cheering sound plays and the bubble moving and animation frame become fast(if you want to see animation,you have to press the animation button in the below,or you will just see the things you find and hear the sound).
#### if you find another thing that cannot be eat,a harsh sound plays and the the bubble moving and animation frame becomes slow(if you want to see animation,you have to press the animation button in the below).
#### if you find your mate,a very  brisk song will play and the background changed.also you will see a peachheart and the animation started(if you havenot press the animation button before) or become fast(if you have press the animation button before).

## There are four interface button below my background:start music, animation, stop music and setting back.
#### start music:play a background music about the sound of the sea.
#### stop music:can stop all the sounds and songs in  this project.
####  animation:start the animation of the jellyfish and waterplants.
#### setting back: return the original website, but different from refresh. For the random target fish is the same.
