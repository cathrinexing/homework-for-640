Inputs 
The length and width of the room
Output
Message telling user the results

First, I use a form text input for length and width. Then I need a button to click to submit my inputs. When the user clicks the button, I'll activate my calculation function. 
In my function, I need to get the value of the form input. I'll grab the number  to multiply them. This will give me a value. Then I'll return a message telling them the value of room area.
