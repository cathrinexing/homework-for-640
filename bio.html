        <h1>MY BIO</h1>
        <p>
My name is Xing Liu and I major in the interactive media design in my first year.
     <br>
     <br>    
As for my background, I got my bachelor’s and master’s degree in china majoring in urban planning and design. Also, I have worked for about 3-4 years in an urban planning and design provincial study institution in china. I have been the project leader for several plans and a participant several times.  I mainly focus on two big kinds of plans:  statutory plan and urban design. My work main content is to make the framework, the conception of the plan. Also, I always went on business trips to investigate the cites or the specific districts which I was going to make plans. The important part is that I had to report my plans to the clients, usually the governments, and the experts in different fields, such as the transportation, infrastructure, environmental protection, finance department and so on. Cause urban planning is a comprehensive and complicated complex. Also, I had to revise the plan according to their advices or give them my explanations to them why I refuse to modify my plan in some point. It turns out to be a lot of negotiations and compromises. I used to have a very heavy workload and worked 6-7 days a week, also didn’t get off work until 8-10pm from Monday to Friday. In fact, I feel very proud when the cities or the district are built based on my plan. You know, it is a kind of achievement.

Here comes to the English learning part. My English performance was good in my high school. And when I went to university, I passed all the required English tests and got the English certifications in the first and second year with no preparation. And then I just left English behind. Cause there is no need for me to learn or use English during my study and work since then. In fact, It was until the end of last year, in which I planed to study aboard, that I started to pick up my English skills. It is almost ten years from now that I don’t use English. You can image that it is really a hard work for me. I sincerely apologize for my poor English expression.  However, I know there is no excuse. I am trying my best to improve it anyway through assignments, presentations and daily lives. I wish I could speak nearly as well as the natives or at lease I can understand what they are saying even they speak very fast during these two years.
